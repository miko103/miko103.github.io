            <h3 style="font-size:180%;"><u>Who was this beautiful man?</u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 30%;">Idk you tell me...</p>
            <p style="font-size: 110%;">This man was a legend. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 110%;">Some people call him <i>The Rock</i>, some people call him <i>Dwayne</i>, or a <i>"Threat to National Security"</i> but to me? <b>to me he was a hero.</b> </p> 
            <p style="font-size: 110%;">But not your typical superman-type hero, but a real hero. Unfortunately, since he isn't with us anymore, I cannot thank him in person for all the great things he has done for us. </p> 
            <p style="font-size: 110%;">What I can do, is make a tribute for an amazing dad, husband, son, internationally wanted terrorist. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 110%;"> We will always keep you in heart and mind my little Pebble. Thanks for everything you have done for us Johnson the Rock Dwockson.</p>
